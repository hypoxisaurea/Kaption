- Language nuances (존댓말/jondaemal, 반말/banmal, humble expressions)
- Social customs (age hierarchy, senior-junior culture)
- Traditional culture (holidays, ancestral rites, traditions)
- Modern Korean culture (PC방/PC bang, 노래방/noraebang, 찜질방/jjimjilbang)
- Education culture (entrance exams, 학원/hagwon, education fever)
- Work culture (overtime, company dinners, hierarchical relationships)
